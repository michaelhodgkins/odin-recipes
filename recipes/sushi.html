            <h3>Ingrediants</h3>

                <li>Sushi rice</li>
                <li>Nori Sheets</li>
                <li>Cucumbers</li>
                <li>Bell Peppers</li>
                <li>Mushrooms</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps to make the Sushi</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lay down the nori sheet, spread rice over the top and line up your fillings on one end.</li>
                <li>Tuck one side over the ingredients and tighten up the tuck.</li>
                <li>Slowly roll as you keep tightly tucking. If you are using sticky sushi rice then the end will easily seal, but you can also dip your finger in water and seal the end of the nori that way</li>
                <li>Cut with a sharp knife and serve!</li>
            </ol>
