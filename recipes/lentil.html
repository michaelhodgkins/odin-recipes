            <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup brown or green lentils</li>
                <li>Carrots</li>
                <li>Vegetable Broth</li>
                <li>Dried Thyme</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps to make the soup</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.</li>
                <li>Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.</li>
            </ol>
